Welcome to the first post in this blog, written by the Kos-Lab team, the Cyber Security unit of [Kryptus](https://kryptus.com), a brazilian Cyber Defense company.

A few weeks ago, we got our hands in a Intelbras Ncloud 300 device, an interesting wireless router, with features like a Torrent Client and USB storage, after a few days taking a look at it, the following was discovered:

## Unprotected Serial port (UART)

Connecting to the serial interface, a root shell was obtained, using this method, the root password hash was also obtained:
`root:uax./Fu15Jqo6:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh`

John the Ripper quickly cracked that hash, the password is: cary

## Unauthenticated configuration backup

When a request to /cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh is done, a configuration "backup" is retrieved, which includes the web interface username and password:

The URL /goform/vpnBasicSettings is also vulnerable to this, being possible to enable or disable the VPN.

## Unauthenticated device reboot

When a request to /goform/RebootSystem is done, the device reboots:
